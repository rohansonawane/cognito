# AI Canvas Lab – Future Feature Concepts

This document captures forward-looking ideas for evolving the AI Canvas Lab across web, mobile, and supporting services. Concepts are grouped by theme to help with roadmap planning and prioritization.

## Collaboration & Accounts
- **Secure user authentication** with OAuth/SAML providers, optional SSO for schools and enterprises.
- **Workspace membership** for teams and classrooms, including role-based permissions (owner, editor, viewer).
- **Realtime collaborative boards** featuring multi-cursor presence, comments, threadable feedback, and resolved/archived states.
- **Board versioning timeline** that records every stroke and note; allow branching, merging, and AI-generated changelog summaries.

## Canvas Intelligence
- **Adaptive AI mentor personas** (educator, product designer, math coach) that tailor tone, structure, and suggested actions.
- **Explainable stroke suggestions** that annotate alternative strokes and include rationale, keeping the user in control.
- **Vision-to-artifact workflows**: convert wireframes into Tailwind/React components, diagrams into Jira tasks, or equations into LaTeX/Notion docs.
- **Canvas simulation sandbox** to prototype UI flows, run physics/math simulations, or evaluate system diagrams with AI commentary on outcomes.
- **Ambient context injection** allowing users to attach reference files; AI fuses them with the board and provides traceability insight.

## Knowledge Capture & Notes
- **Auth-backed note collections** synchronized across devices, with offline support and conflict resolution.
- **AI-assisted note summaries** per board, including extracted tasks, follow-ups, and decision logs.
- **Smart categorization and tagging** driven by detected content (e.g., “Electrical Engineering”, “UI Wireframe”) with editable taxonomy.
- **Cross-board semantic search** to find related sketches, notes, or AI responses by concept instead of keywords.

## Input & Tools
- **Expanded shape/stencil library** (arrows, flowchart symbols, circuit elements, sticky notes) with quick styling presets.
- **Handwriting OCR & equation parsing** to transform annotations into editable text or symbolic math (LaTeX, MathML).
- **Voice-to-sketch guidance** where narrated instructions generate starter shapes or annotations.
- **Custom brush engine** supporting textures, pressure curves, symmetry modes, and dynamic color palettes.

## Export & Integrations
- **Multi-format export** including SVG, layered PSD, PDF with annotations, and transparent PNG sequences.
- **Workflow integrations** with Notion, Confluence, Google Classroom, LMS/LTI 1.3, Slack/Teams, and GitHub/GitLab issues.
- **Automated presentation builder** that assembles slide decks or shareable reports from selected boards and AI summaries.
- **API & webhooks** to embed the canvas in other platforms and trigger automations when boards change.

## Mobile & Offline
- **Unified iOS and Android parity** with native feel, haptics, and platform-specific gesture optimizations.
- **Offline-first mode** letting users sketch and queue AI requests or note updates for later sync.
- **Device sensor features** such as tilt-to-pan, stylus button support, or AR overlays for projecting boards onto surfaces.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- **Accessibility advisor** that flags color contrast issues, missing labels, or dense layouts and proposes fixes.
- **Screen reader-friendly annotations** and keyboard-centric navigation for the full toolset.
- **Localized AI responses** supporting multiple languages with cultural context awareness.

## Governance & Safety
- **Fine-grained content controls** (moderation, sensitivity filters) for educational and enterprise compliance.
- **Audit logs & analytics** that track usage patterns, AI interactions, and export history for admins.
- **Data residency options** with regional deployment choices and encryption at rest for stored boards/notes.

## Monetization & Engagement
- **Feature tiering** (free vs. premium) with defined quotas for AI usage, storage, and collaboration seats.
- **Template marketplace** for reusable board layouts, lesson plans, or design systems.
- **Gamified learning paths** offering achievements, lesson modules, or AI-led challenges for structured practice.

This list is intentionally expansive. Treat it as an exploration space—use product discovery, user interviews, and feasibility spikes to determine which ideas should graduate into the roadmap.
